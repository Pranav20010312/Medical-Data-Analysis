# **Medical Data Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing medical data to uncover key insights and optimize the hospital's performance. The following steps were performed:

• Data Preparation: A Medical Database was developed and the data was imported and organized using MS SQL. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to 
  ensure data quality.

• Data Exploration: MS SQL queries were used to explore the medical data and extract relevant information. Key metrics and statistics were calculated to gain 
  insights into the hospital's performance.

• Interactive Power BI Dashboard: A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and present the analyzed medical data. DAX measures were utilized to calculate key 
  metrics and provide a comprehensive view of the hospital's performance.

## **Key Insights:**
Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

• Male patients are admitted more frequently than female patients.

• The hospital's doctor salaries cost approximately $300k per month.

• Patient fees bring in around $333k per month, resulting in a profit of just $33k per month.

## **Solution:**

•	To increase profits, the proposed solution is to focus on increasing patient volume through effective marketing strategies and partnerships with other healthcare 
  providers.
  
•	By attracting more patients to the hospital, revenue can be maximized, resulting in higher profits.


## **Technologies Used:**
• MS SQL: Employed for data organization, cleaning, and exploration using SQL queries.

• Power BI: Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and present the analyzed medical data.

• DAX: Utilized in Power BI to calculate key metrics and enable deeper insights.
